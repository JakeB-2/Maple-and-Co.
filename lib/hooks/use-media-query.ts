 * useMediaQuery — subscribe to a CSS media query and re-render on changes.

 * corrected synchronously from `matchMedia` (the `useState` initialiser reads it
 * on the client). Consumers that only branch on the result while a portal/overlay
 * is closed (the common case) see no hydration flash because the branched DOM
 * isn't mounted until the user opens it.
 *
 * Generic on purpose: it powers the work-entry editor's viewport→presentation
 * choice today, but stays a plain media-query primitive so a container-width
 * strategy can later be swapped in without changing call sites that just need
 * "is this viewport wide?".

/**
 * Device-neutral INPUT-ergonomics axis (capability-based), kept deliberately
 * SEPARATE from the width/layout axis (`useIsMobile`, `useMediaQuery('(min-width:768px)')`,
 * the locked 768 reflow grammar). The two axes must never be conflated into one
 * "isMobile" — a touch laptop is coarse-pointer AND wide, and should keep the
 * desktop *layout* while getting touch *ergonomics*.
 *
 * Query policy (the load-bearing correctness rule):
 *  - "Device can be TOUCHED" → `(any-pointer: coarse)`. Use to enlarge tap
 *    targets and surface tap affordances. `(pointer: coarse)` is WRONG here: it
 *    reports only the PRIMARY pointer, so a trackpad-primary touch laptop
 *    reports `fine` and would be starved.
 *  - "No reliable HOVER" → `(hover: none)`. Use to replace hover-only reveals
 *    (tooltip → popover, hover-expand → tap-expand). A hybrid laptop with a
 *    mouse reports `(hover: hover)`, so it correctly keeps the hover affordance
 *    while still getting larger tap targets from `usePointerCoarse()`.
 *
 * The matching CSS layer uses `@media (any-pointer: coarse)` / `@media (hover: none)`
 * blocks and the Tailwind `pointer-coarse:` variant (simple cases only).
